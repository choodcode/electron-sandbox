What's the deal with electron?

This was a basic app, created based on the shell from the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

## To Use

```bash
# Install dependencies and run the app
npm install && ./node_modules/.bin/electron .
```
