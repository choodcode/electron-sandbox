# electron-sandbox
What's the deal with electron?

This was a basic app, created based on the shell from the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

## To Use

From command line:

```bash
# Install dependencies and run the app
npm install && npm start
```

If electron is not installed globally, there may be issues running the npm start command. If so, then run the following command instead:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/electron .
```
